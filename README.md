# Perseus Equipment AI Hackathon

Welcome to the Perseus Equipment AI Hackathon. Your challenge is to turn a real-world style dealership operations database into an intelligent analytics platform that helps business users understand customers, sales, service work, and inventory health.

The database for this challenge is `perseus_equipment_database.db`, a SQLite database. You will receive it separately. Copy it into the root of this workspace before you start.

## Company Story

Perseus Equipment is a fictional regional equipment dealership serving contractors, landscapers, municipalities, farmers across the Midwest.

The company sells compact construction equipment, replacement parts, attachments, and service work. Over years of growth, Perseus collected a large amount of operational data in its dealer management system, but managers still rely on manual reports, spreadsheets, and tribal knowledge to answer basic questions:

- Which customers are growing, slowing down, or at risk?
- What parts and equipment categories drive the most revenue?
- How healthy is inventory?
- What service work is moving through the shop?
- Where should sales, service, and inventory teams focus next?

Your job is to build an analytics platform that makes this data easier to explore and act on.

All customer names and customer numbers in the shared database have been anonymized with random company-style names and random customer numbers. Treat the data as sensitive anyway and avoid exposing raw credentials, passwords, hashes, or internal-only fields in your application.

## Challenge Goal

Build an analytics dashboard application that helps Perseus Equipment understand how the business is performing.

Your platform should combine:

- Clear executive KPIs.
- Charts and graphs.
- Drill-down workflows.
- Customer, inventory, sales, and service insights.

## Database Overview

The database is SQLite and contains dealer operations data across customers, invoices, parts, units,  payments, service work, locations, and lookup tables.

Important notes:

- Dates are stored mostly as `TEXT` values in timestamp-like formats.
- Monetary and quantity values are stored mostly as `NUMERIC`.
- Many tables include `IsActive`, `EntDate`, `ModDate`, `EntBy`, and `ModBy`.
- Customer names and numbers can appear both in master tables and denormalized transaction tables.
- Invoice records are central to many analytics workflows.
- Useful invoice statuses include `finalized`, `archived`, `voided`, `quote`, `committed`, and `draft`.
- For revenue analytics, prefer posted invoice statuses such as `finalized` and `archived`.

## Key Business Areas

### Customers

Use these tables for customer analytics:

- `Customer`: customer master records, including `CustomerId`, `CustomerNo`, `CustomerName`, active flag, credit fields, and location references.

Suggested customer insights:

- Top customers by revenue.
- Customer invoice count and average invoice value.
- Last purchase date.
- Customer activity trends over time.

### Parts Inventory and Parts Sales

Use these tables for parts analytics:

- `PartMaster`: part master catalog with `PartId`, `MfgId`, `PartStatus`, `PartType`, `PartNo`, `Description`, and active flag.
- `PartLocation`: location-level part settings such as bins, min stock, max stock, count schedules, and stocking rules.
- `PartManufacturer`: manufacturer lookup.
- `PartGroup`: part group lookup.
- `PartProductLine`: product line lookup.
- `SalePart`: sold parts linked to invoice detail through `ItemId`, including `PartId`, `PartNo`, `Qty`, `UnitPrice`, `NetExt`, `AvgCost`, and manufacturer code.

Suggested parts insights:

- Top selling parts by revenue.
- Top selling parts by quantity.
- Parts sales velocity over time.
- Part sales margin estimates using `NetExt` and `AvgCost` where available.
- Parts by manufacturer.
- Parts with configured min/max stock.
- Parts without useful stocking policy.
- Drill down from a part to invoices where it was sold.

Note: this dataset exposes useful parts catalog and sales data, but may not expose a simple current on-hand quantity column. Be careful with assumptions. If you calculate inventory health, explain what fields you used.

### Equipment and Unit Inventory

Use these tables for whole-good equipment and unit analytics:

- `UnitBase`: equipment/unit master records, including `UnitId`, `StockNo`, `UnitCategoryId`, `UnitConditionId`, `Make`, `Model`, `Year`, `StockStatus`, `BaseRetail`, `BaseCost`.
- `UnitCategory`: unit category lookup.
- `UnitCondition`: condition lookup.
- `UnitMake`: make lookup.
- `UnitSerial`: serial and warranty information.
- `UnitCustomer`: customer/unit history with invoice amount, trade amount, list amount, configured cost, source, and event date.
- `SaleUnit`: unit sale details.
- `SaleUnitTradeIn`: trade-in details.
